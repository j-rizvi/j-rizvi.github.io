			<p>I created 5-10 questionnaires which was sent out to my friends, and family members. The survey contained questions regards to my strengths, weakness that people have seen me over the years. Below are details analysis of my brand.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<h2>Strengths</h2>
			
			<p>It was good to see the reflection of my strengths and things that I accelerate in. Based on the responses one thing I am good at being a successful leader. I can agree with this response. Leadership is something that I have worked overtime and developed that skill sets throughout the years. For example, when I worked at MasterCard as an intern. I was assigned to lead a team of eight interns with different educational backgrounds for a hackathon project. Dividing the work into sub-teams made the project look achievable.  Further, all the sub-teams were able to establish a solid flow of communication because they knew what they were doing.  We worked on the project for two weeks and we were able to successfully finish the project on time. Responses were similar to what I thought and I believed in.</p>
			
			
			<p>Another thing that stood out was I am an inspirational motivator, and an individual who takes things in consideration. The responses did not surprise me as I find myself inspiring, supporting, and motivating others to grow in depth as a leader who understands social needs. For example, I like to have an open dialogue and make others feel good around me. I try to enable others to think about different strategies to solve a wide range of problems.</p>

			
			
			<hr/>
			<h2>Weakness</h2>
			
				<p>I asked my peers to keep the all the response anonymous so that I can get an honest and true reflection of myself so that I can undestand my weakness. For example, there was a question in relates to “Identify Adaptive Challenges . I believe that I do not adjust to the dynamics of complex situations easily while having 2-3 different tasks on my hand. Reponses were similar to what I thought, some people said I overreact to things during tense situations. However, this is something I am working on and I overcoming this obstacle with achievable goals. </p> 

				<p>Further my responses were in below in the following category: sensitive, determined, conscientious, and others. These results showed me how others look at my trait qualities. An eye-opener for me was “determination”, where I believed I was able to help out make my own decisions, however, I was received similar responses from my peers saying I don’t show confidence in decision-making. I am working and growing on that skills sets. To talks about sensitiveness, sometimes I make decisions from the heart rather than my mind which can be a problematic. </p>

				<p>There were some similarities and differences in my and other’s responses. Some common theme I found was leadership and responsibility. Some differences I found from my response to other was determination, and sensitive. </p>  

			<hr/>
			
			<h2>My feature benefit</h2>
				
				<p>Overall, I was able to learn about my strength and weakness to improve, build and grown as a person. I want to grow in depth as a technologist and in breadth as a leader who understands social activities. We need examples of leadership that involves both service and influence to grow awareness of humanity in our community. It is toward that purpose that I aspire to work on my leadership skills throughout my career to serve the community. I want to be an example that inspires others. I want to create a vibrant, safe and more sustainable world. That's the whole summary of my brand. If you don't like it, no hard feelings, but if you want a brand that has these qualities, then I think we are in for a long ride.</p>
